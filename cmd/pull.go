It fetches it to same directory/folder structure where it was stored with "spec.json" filename at the end
or ending with "{branch}.json" at the end to perform dynamic branch matching with GitHub Flow (feature-branch,main).
E.g. 'pull pacts/foo/bar/{branch}.json' command will store a file 'pacts/foo/bar/spec.json'.

The paths can be a list of paths separated by comma and with optional version definition after # sign. Like:
"paths/foo/bar/test.json#some-v3rsion-1D,paths/foo/baz/{branch}.json#oth3r-v3rsion-1D"
When paths are resolved with same values last definition is downloaded.
