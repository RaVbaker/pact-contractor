	Short: "Handy way to do pull && command && submit verification-status",
	Long: `Useful helper to execute common steps when contract is verified.

These steps are:
1. pulling the contract from S3 by [path]
2. running a command to verify the contract
3. submitting the verification status: success/failure

All flags possible for pull & submit are available for the verify command.
The path from first argument can be substituted in --cmd with "{path}" pattern,
which default value is for Ruby "bundle exec rake pact:verify:at[{path}]".
But feel free to set the "cmd" in config file for convenience.
Submitted status is detected from exitCode and 0 is interpreted as "success"
and any other as "failure".`,

	// Here you will define your flags and configuration settings.

	// Cobra supports Persistent Flags which will work for this command
	// and all subcommands, e.g.:
	// verifyCmd.PersistentFlags().String("foo", "", "A help for foo")

	// Cobra supports local flags which will only run when this command
	// is called directly, e.g.:
	verifyCmd.Flags().StringVar(&verificationCommand, "cmd", "bundle exec rake pact:verify:at[{path}]", "Command to execute during verification, {path} is replaced with provided [path].")
