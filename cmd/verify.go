	Use:   "verify [path] --cmd [command]",
	Short: "Handy way to do pull && command && submit verification-status",
	Long: `Useful helper to execute common steps when contract is verified.

These steps are:
1. pulling the contract from S3 by [path]
2. running a command to verify the contract
3. submitting the verification status: success/failure
4. cleanup and remove fetched file

All flags possible for pull & submit are available for the verify command.
The path from first argument can be substituted in --cmd with "{path}" pattern,
which default value is for Ruby "bundle exec rake pact:verify:at[{path}]".
But feel free to set the "cmd" in config file for convenience.
Submitted status is detected from exitCode and 0 is interpreted as "success"
and any other as "failure".

If the {branch} pattern is used in the path and the currently provided/examined
branch doesn't have a contract then the submit of verification will fail`,
	Args: cobra.ExactArgs(1),
	RunE: func(cmd *cobra.Command, args []string) error {
		path := args[0]
		return verification.Run(viper.GetString("cmd"), path, s3VersionID, gitBranchName, cmd, pullCmd, submitCmd)
	},

func init() {
	rootCmd.AddCommand(verifyCmd)
	verifyCmd.Flags().AddFlagSet(pullCmd.LocalFlags())
	verifyCmd.Flags().AddFlagSet(submitCmd.LocalFlags())

	// Here you will define your flags and configuration settings.

	// Cobra supports Persistent Flags which will work for this command
	// and all subcommands, e.g.:
	// verifyCmd.PersistentFlags().String("foo", "", "A help for foo")

	// Cobra supports local flags which will only run when this command
	// is called directly, e.g.:
	verifyCmd.Flags().StringVar(&verificationCommand, "cmd", "bundle exec rake pact:verify:at[{path}]", "Command to execute during verification, {path} is replaced with provided [path].")
}
